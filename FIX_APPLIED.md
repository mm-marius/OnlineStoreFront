# âœ… Tailwind CSS Issue Fixed!

## Problem
The `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module was trying to use **Tailwind CSS v4**, which changed how it works with PostCSS and is not yet compatible.

## Solution Applied
Installed **Tailwind CSS v3.4.0** which is compatible with `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss`.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.4.0 postcss@^8.4.0 autoprefixer@^10.4.0
```

## What Changed
- âœ… Removed incompatible Tailwind CSS v4
- âœ… Installed Tailwind CSS v3.4.0
- âœ… Installed PostCSS and Autoprefixer
- âœ… Server should now start without errors

## Test It Now

The dev server is starting in the background. Wait about **30 seconds**, then visit:

**http://localhost:3001** or **http://localhost:3002** or **http://localhost:3003**

(The port number depends on which ports were already in use)

You should now see:
- âœ¨ Beautiful homepage with Tailwind styling
- No 503 errors
- Full Tailwind CSS v3 working

## If You Still See Issues

1. **Stop all dev servers** (find all terminals running `npm run dev` and press Ctrl+C)
2. **Delete the `.nuxt` folder** (if it exists)
3. **Run**: `npm run dev`
4. **Check the terminal** to see which port it's using (e.g., http://localhost:3001)

## Installed Versions
- Tailwind CSS: **v3.4.0** âœ…
- PostCSS: **v8.4.0** âœ…
- Autoprefixer: **v10.4.0** âœ…
- @nuxtjs/tailwindcss: **Latest** âœ…

Everything should work now! ðŸŽ‰
